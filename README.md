Conventions:

- Private route folders use an `_components` directory next to the page that owns them.
- Pages under the admin area call `requireUser()` from `src/lib/data/session.ts`; API routes return 401 JSON instead of redirecting.
- Dates are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` and displayed in the Buddhist era via `src/lib/format.ts`.
- Water (150 baht/person) and electricity (7 baht/unit) rates live in `src/lib/billing.ts`.

## Move-out and deposit settlement

A tenancy starts with a deposit (two months' rent by default) and one month's rent in advance. The tenant gives a month's
notice: the rent of the notice month is waived (the advance rent covers it). After the tenant has moved out, the room page
shows "สรุปเงินมัดจำผู้เช่าเดิม" and `/rooms/<code>/settlement/<tenantId>` does the settlement:

- electricity from the last billed meter to the move-out reading (7 baht/unit) and water (150 baht/person), both editable;
- damage and other deductions, one row each;
- unpaid issued bills are taken from the deposit and marked paid when the settlement is closed;
- refund = deposit - deductions (negative = the tenant still owes); closing records the transfer date, reference and slip
  (private `refund-slips` bucket).

The logic lives in `save_move_out_settlement` / `close_move_out_settlement` / `reopen_move_out_settlement`
(migration `20261018090000_move_out_settlement.sql`, tested in `tests/db/7-settlement.test.ts`). Apply the migration to the
Supabase project before deploying the app.

`supabase/scripts/clear-room-data.sql` clears one room's test data by hand (preview first, then delete in one transaction).

## Production setup

Required environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain
LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=
LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
CRON_SECRET=
```

After pulling the latest branch, apply database changes:

```bash
npx supabase db push --dry-run
npx supabase db push
```

Configure the LINE Messaging API webhook URL as:

```text
https://your-production-domain/api/line/webhook
```

Enable webhooks in LINE Developers. Keep the Channel Secret, Channel Access Token, and Supabase service role key only in the hosting provider's server environment; never expose them in browser code or commit them to Git.

To link a tenant, open the room page, create a one-time LINE code, and ask the tenant to send the complete `HOME39 ...` message to the official account within 15 minutes. New bills are sent automatically when LINE is linked, and can also be sent again from the bill detail page.

Vercel runs `/api/cron/bill-reminders` every day at 08:00 Thailand time. Set `CRON_SECRET` to a long random value so only the scheduler can call this endpoint. The job sends one reminder three days before the due date and one overdue notification after the due date.
